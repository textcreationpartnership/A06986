            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>BV.</hi> The Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt <hi>Marke</hi> beginneth the hyſtory of the Goſpell at the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme &amp; doctryne of <hi>IOHN</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, ſhewing what he taught, what hee witneſſed of Chryſte the Lord, how he behaued himſelfe, &amp; baptized Chriſte. To the whych hee addeth out of hand, how Chriſte was anoynted and reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, how hee was exercyſed with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſe temptation: and laſt of all, how hee came forth and preached the Kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. <hi>C.</hi> Therefore, although it be part of the Goſpell which <hi>Math.</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> doe declare and ſet forth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt and ſecond Chapter of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall hyſtory, yet notwithſtanding it is not from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter that <hi>Marke</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the beginning of the Goſpell in the preaching of <hi>Iohn</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Baptiſt, For then at the laſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law &amp; the prophets had an ende, as it is written,<note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law &amp; the Prophets raigned vntil Iohn: &amp; ſince that time the Kingdome of GOD is preached, and euery man ſtryueth to goe in.</hi> And to this aptly agreeth the Teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>Mallachy</hi> which hee alleadgeth. To the ende the Lorde might the more inflame mens myndes to deſire the promyſed ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he purpoſed and determyned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryue the people for a time of new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies. And wee know that <hi>Mallachy</hi> was the laſt of the lawful and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prophets. But leaſt the hungery <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould peariſh in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, hee exhorteth them to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnder the Lawe of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> vntill the promiſed redemption appeare. For he only maketh mention of the Lawe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the doctrine of the Prophets did nothing differ from the ſame, but was only an appendix and more perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the whole order of gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninge the Church myght hange of the Lawe. Neyther is it a newe or vnwo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing in the Scripture to haue the propheſies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of the Lawe, becauſe all were ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it as to theyr wellſpryng and ſcope.</p>
               <p>But the Goſpel was not as it were an inferiour augmentation of the Lawe: but a newe forme of teachinge whych ſhould abrogate that former maner of inſtruction. And <hi>Mallachy</hi> making y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of the Church of two ſortes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted the firſt vnder the Lawe: and begynneth the other at the preachinge of <hi>Iohn.</hi> For there is no doubt but that hee meaneth <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth, <hi>Behould I ſend my meſſenger:</hi> becauſe (as we ſayd euen now) there is here put a manifeſt difference betwene the law and the new order and ſtate of the Church which ſhould ſucceede.

the ſame ſence he alleaged a litle before the ſame place y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the euangeliſt <hi>Marke</hi> hath (for the places are like in al poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) ſaying: <hi>Beholde I ſend vnto you Elias the Prophet, before that great day of the Lord come.</hi> In lyke maner hee ſayth:<note place="margin">Mala. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold I will ſend my meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger whych ſhall prepare the way before mee: and the Lorde whom yee would haue: ſhall ſoone come to hys Temple.</hi> Becauſe in both places a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition of the Church is promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than was vnder the lawe, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpell without all doubt is noted. But truely before the Lorde ſhoulde come forth, a preparer or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner is ſayd to come, which ſhoulde proclayme hym to be at hand. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee gather that the abrogation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe and the beginning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell is properly placed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Moreouer, ſeeing <hi>Iohn</hi> doth commend and ſet forth Chriſte in the fleſhe, both his natiuity and alſo the whole hiſtory of offeringe ſaluation is contayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. But <hi>Marke</hi> intreateth here how the Goſpell began to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and publiſhed openly. Wherefore hee doth not without good cauſe begin at <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt miniſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And here by the heauenly Father went about to keepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe of his ſonne buried as it were in ſilence, vntill the tyme of full &amp; perfect reuelation came. For it was not done without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certaine prouidence of God that the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts ſhould pretermit all that time in which Chriſte led a priuate lyfe with his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at home, and ſhoulde omit all the tyme of his infancy vntill hee was thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares of age, at what time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge forth was openly declared to the whole world to be the redeemer: Only the Euangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> doth briefly ſhew a proofe of his calling to come about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twelueth yeare of his age.<note place="margin">Luke. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This thing (truly) did greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the matter, firſt of all to know that Chriſte was a true man: and then that he was the ſonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> This thinge the Lorde woulde haue to be declared vnto vs by witnes. The other thyngs which <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> doe ſhewe of the Sheepeherdes, of the wyſe men, and of <hi>Symeon,</hi> they pertayne to prooue his dyuinity. But whereas <hi>Luke</hi> doth ſpeake ſpecially of <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; of his Father <hi>Zacharias,</hi> it was a certayne entraunce and preface of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[The beginning of the Goſpell]</hi> If we place theſe wordes after this maner it wil be a more perfect ſentence: <hi>The Goſpell of Ieſu Chriſte the ſonne of God began after the ſame maner as it is written in the Prophets,</hi> Or els, <hi>The Goſpel of Ieſu Chriſt the ſonne God had ſuch a beginning, as the Prophets declared before that it ſhould haue, namely E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and Mallachy:</hi> That is to ſay that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhoulde bee the forerunner, and ſhould be the firſt that ſhould begin to preach the Goſpell, and not Chriſte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were the head of the Goſpel. For the ſame <hi>Iohn</hi> began to preach the the Goſpell, and to declare him to bee at hand which was promiſed. And thus it pleaſed God that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould be the forerunner with a certayne ſeuere, and auſtere kinde of lyfe, becauſe he was ſo nigh to the ſeuere &amp; ſtrayte lawe. But Chriſt being meeke and gentle was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milliarly conuerſaunt among men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the pledge of Gods grace and mercy. In this, hee tooke from the <hi>Iewes</hi> all excuſe, leaſte they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Goſpell eyther to ſeeme to ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or to ſeuere. <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore was the firſt that began to preache the Goſpel, as the Prophets foreſhewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Of Ieſu Chryſte the ſonne of God.]</hi> The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith here that Chriſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1180:5"/>
is the ſonne of God, but <hi>Mathew</hi> ſayth onely that hee was the ſonne of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> But the meaning of <hi>Marke</hi> is that wee ſhould not hope for redemption, but onely of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[As it is vvrighten in the Prophets] <hi>E</hi>
                  </hi> Two olde Greeke bookes haue, <hi>In Eſay the Prophet:</hi> but it is more truely red, <hi>In the Prophets.</hi> Whereuppon alſo hee Ioyneth two Teſtimonies to declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was <hi>Iohn</hi> of whom both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets ſpake, <hi>[Behold I ſend my meſſenger) <hi>C.</hi>
                  </hi> The chaunging of the perſon in theſe words hath no abſurdity. So God hymſelfe ſpeaketh by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Mala 3.</note> ſaying, I ſend my Angell which ſhall prepare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way before me. And <hi>Marke</hi> bringeth in the Father ſpeaking to the ſonne.

Wherefore if wee ſpeake of this ſanctification, all workes which are contrary to faith as are thoſe which we call ſinnes agaynſt God, are not only forbidden to be done on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aboth, but on all other dayes alſo. The other ſanctification is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and it commeth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> externall and Eccleſiaſticall myniſtery, by the preaching of the worde of God (vnder the which preaching the ſacrifices alſo which the <hi>Iewes</hi> offered were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended which were nothing els than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of Chryſte Ieſus) and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpenſation of the ſacraments.

Yf therefore wee ſpeake of this ſanctification, then the law forbiddeth thoſe workes which keepe men backe from the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God from the ſacrifices, and the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments. But theſe are the chiefe, as tilling of the ground, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our dayly occupation, &amp; ſuch like kinde of buſineſſe. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was lawefull in the time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to doe thoſe works on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saboth day which were not altogether a let &amp; a hinderance from doing thoſe holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes which were appoynted to bee done on the Saboth: as, to heale the ſicke, to prouyde meate and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaryes, to leade Sheepe, and Oxen to the water, to drawe an Oxe or Aſſe out of a pit, and ſuch lyke. Some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes pertayned to ſanctification, as to circumſiſe Chyldren to kill ſacrifices &amp; ſuch lyke. And of both theſe kynde of workes Chriſte maketh mencion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he declareth the Saboth in this place ſaying that it is lawfull to do good on the Saboth day, as to heale the ſicke, and to ſaue a mans Lyfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in health. For this worke doth not let, but that a man may heare the preaching of Gods worde, and may be preſent at the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: for theſe were the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon works of the Saboth commaunded in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time of the lawe. By theſe thinges truly it is manifeſt, when the Lawe ſayeth: <hi>Thou ſhalt doe no maner of vvorke on the Saboth,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſpeaketh not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plely of all maner of workes, but only of thoſe which are an impediment and let that the Saboth cannot be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that is to ſay, that thoſe works ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming &amp; teſtifying of fayth. By theſe things alſo we may perceyue what we ought to thinke of the Sonday, which the Chriſtians obſerue and keepe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſteede of the Saboth.

Neyther did our Elders without great conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration poynte that day which wee call Sonday, in ſteede of the <hi>Ievves</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aoth.

For we muſt meditate in this worlde of that thynge which we hope to obtayne in the world to come.

                  </hi> What hee meaneth by doing good he playnely ſheweth when he reſtoreth health to the ſicke man. Therefore of the contrary, it is to do euell, not to be carefull for a ſicke perſon and to helpe him if thou maiſte. The which what is it els then to deſtroy and kill a man? <hi>E.</hi> The wordes of Chriſt therefore are as much in effecte as if he ſhould haue ſayd: Yee ſee this miſerable creature, to whom there is no good man but he wiſheth health, whom, who ſo euer would haue neglected, he ſheweth him ſelfe not only farre from humanity, but

alſo from Religion. To what ende therefore doe yee thinke that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both was ordayned? Eyther to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, as to neglect thoſe whom yee may help?

So <hi>Luke</hi> in the ende of the fourth Chapter maketh menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he went into a deſert place, and that when the people which followed him would haue ſtayed him, he ſayd, I muſt preach to other Cities alſo, and ſo ſent them away. For he addeth ſaying: <hi>And he preached in the Synagoges of Galile.</hi> The like you may reade in the fyft of <hi>Luke.</hi> Euen ſo at this time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he went a part when he ſaw the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: (as ſayth <hi>Mathew</hi>) and paſſed away the Night in prayer.

               <p>The Apoſtles were ſente to preache; but being now returned they gather themſelues together vnto Ieſus, and and to declare what they had done and taught.

               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1180:29"/>They thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by this meanes they might obſcure the glory of Chriſt, and of his doctrine, if the Diſciples could not anſwer exactly vnto al thinges, or if they might make ſome part of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of the Diſciples manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people. And as it may appere by this our Euangeliſt, their diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was about caſting out of deuils, and of the power of Chryſt, which hee had geuen to his Diſciples to exercyſe in his name: as may be gathered by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is written in the <hi>17.</hi> Verſe follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.

               <p>He had this reuerence both for his doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine and life alſo. <hi>C.</hi> Hereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that many of thoſe which wer pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent at this diſputation were not euyll affectioned towardes him, becauſe ſo ſoone as they ſee him, they ſalute him, yea: and his preſence doth ceaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rage of the Scribes, becauſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wer aſked whereof they diſputed, they held theyr peace.

ſometimes he doth ſo raigne that hys kyngdome doth not appeare.

What profite haſt thou in brynging thys thy ſon.</p>
               <p>This man is commonly a prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Deuill to make him more mad: but we may not iudge by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning we muſt alwayes waighte for the ende.

                  <hi>C.</hi> Becauſe the Father of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chyld thought nothing of Chryſt more then of a man, his falſe Opinion is correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted For it was neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his Faithe ſhould be framed, ſo that it might bee capeable of the grace which hee deſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For this exception of Chryſt (If thou canſt belieue) is as much as if he had ſayd: Thou prayeſt me to helpe if I can, but truly thou ſhalt finde in me a bottomles well of Vertue, if ſo bee thou bringe with thee a Buckette of Faith bigge inough to draw the ſame. To the ende therefore thou ſhouldeſt not doubte but that I can, I requyre of thee thy Fayth. If thou haſte not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which thou demaundeſt, the faulte is in thee, not in mee. And heere a verye profitable Doctrine may be gathered which ſhall Generally pertayne to vs all: Namely, that the cauſe why we haue not the Fruition of Gods Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites oftentimes is the weakeneſſe of our Fayth. Oftentimes we complain of God becauſe hee is not preſent with vs, and becauſe wee feele not hys po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but ſuch complayntes are Wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſeeing we our ſelues are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe.</p>
               <q>(All things are poſſible to him that belieueth)</q>
               <p>There is no doubte but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chryſte taught that the fulnes of goodnes was geuen to him of the Father, and that we ſhould hope no leſſe to receyue all maner of helpe at hys Hand, then at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of hys Father: as if he had ſaid Onelie Belyeue, and thou ſhalt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. So in the Goſpell after <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> he ſayth: Yf yee haue Faith like a Grayne of Muſtard Seede, yee ſhall ſay to this Mountaine, remooue from hence thyther, and it ſhall remoue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any thinge be impoſſible to you. All thynges are ſayd to be poſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wyth GOD, becauſe hee can gieue and bryng to paſſe all thynges. And all things are ſayd to bee poſſible vnto men, when they are capeable of ſome thinge: as waxe can receiue the Seale beyng Impreſſed in it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is impoſſible for the ſtone and Water do. All thinges therefore are poſſible to him, that belieueth, that is, ther is nothing which the belieuing man can not obtayne at the hands of God. The Lord meaneth that his Father wyll neuer forſake vs if wee be capeable of his Grace.</p>
               <p>GOD can do all Thynges, but we cannot obtayne thoſe things that wee would haue without fayth. Therefore <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſayth. But let him aſke in fayth without doubtinge. So Chryſte ſayd vnto the two blynd men.<note place="margin">Iames 1. Math 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Doe ye belyeue that I can do this?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The cauſe which they alleage for them ſelues is, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he followeth not Chriſt: as if they ſhould ſay, he is not thy Diſciple as we are, why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall he be made equal to vs in dignity. <hi>R.</hi> Here therefore we haue another in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diſciples as concerning the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of Chryſt.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>. LVKE, the faithfull wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Hiſtorye, was the inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Companion of the Apoſtle Paule, euen as hee playnely gieueth Teſtimony of him ſelfe. Many affirme that thys Luke was at the firſt by his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Phiſition at Antioche. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, when hee came to the Knowledge of Chriſte, that he was ſtudiouſe in the Faith, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Chriſtian piety to his great commendation: and they apply vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to him this place of S. Paule. Deare Lucas the Phiſition greeteth you. <hi>A.</hi> The which notwithſtandinge hereafter wee will ſhew to bee very vnlykely.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 4.14</note> But their opinion is more probable, which affirme hym to be one of thoſe three, which brought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> latter Epiſtle to the Corinthians, as wee may reade in the 18. verſe of the 8. Chapter to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.<note place="margin">2. Timot. 4.11.</note> And this is without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, that Paule made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this our Euangeliſte, when hee wrote thus vnto Philemon: Marcus,<note place="margin">2. Timo. 2.8.</note> Ariſtarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow labourers ſalute you. And writinge vnto Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, hee ſheweth that hee ſuffered with him all maner of perilles for the name of Chriſt, when as all the reſt of his fellowes either forſooke him, or els fell away. Luke (ſaith he) is with me alone. <hi>C.</hi> Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge that which Euſebius affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth is to childiſh as that Paule is the Author of that Goſpell, of the which S. Luke beareth the name, becauſe he maketh mention of his Goſpell. As though it did not euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye appeare by that which is ſtraight after added, that hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the whole preaching, and not of one Booke. For he ſaith, For the which I ſuffer trouble, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to bondes. And it is certain that he did not ſuffer bonds, for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Booke, but becauſe he did miniſter &amp; preach with ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>A.</hi> More ouer this faithfull Seruaunte of Chryſt. S. Luke hath left vnto vs two ſacred Histories, the which he hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no leſſe diligently the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faithfully. <hi>R.</hi> In the firſt hee hath written both Learnedly and alſo most plainely, concerning the acts, Doctrine and Ghoſpell of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath very artificially pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned the Actes of the Apoſtles of chriſt from the time of his aſſention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heauen. And both theſe hee he queathed to a certaine godly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man named Theophilus his deare friend: <hi>C.</hi> that hauinge the cuſtody of this Heauenly treaſure, hee might faithfully leaue and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame vnto his Poſterity. <hi>A.</hi>

               <p>Therefore it ſeemeth not meete, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Doctryne, which belongeth not to one or to two, &amp; no more, but to all eſtates of men, ſhould be by him priuately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to his <hi>Theophilus.</hi> Hereupon it came to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome thoughte this word <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to be a name appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue, and that al the Godly are called <hi>theophilos,</hi> that is to ſay Louers of God, of the Greeke worde <hi>Theos</hi> and <hi>Philos.</hi> To the which Opinion the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithete whych is therewithal added is contrary: For hee calleth him, <hi>Moſt exellent Theophilus.</hi> And, wee neede not be a fearde, of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> abſurdity, which mooued them to that Iudgement and opinion: for the doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>Paule,</hi> doth not therefore the leſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne to all men, becauſe hee hath dedicated ſome of his Epiſtells to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Cytties, and other ſome alſo to men. Nay, if wee call to mynde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their times, we will confeſſe that this was very well &amp; wiſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene and done of <hi>Luke;</hi> The Worlde was full of Tyrants, which with feare and terrors hindered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe of their Doctrine. This gaue ſathan and his miniſters occaſion to diſperſe abroade the cloudes of errors, which might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and trouble the pure light. And becauſe the common ſort of men were not carefull ynough for the keeping of the purity of the Goſpell, and fewe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently wayghed what ſathan crafte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went about, and how great daunger there was in ſuch fallacies and ſubtill ſnares: as euery man excelled others in fayth which was rare, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gyftes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite, ſo it became him to vſe the greater care and dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to keepe the Doctrine of Piety, all that hee coulde, pure and vnſpotted from all corruption. Such were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God to be as it were preſeruers of his woorde, and faythfully to leaue and to Diſpoſe vnto their Poſterity, the heauenly Doctrine which they had in their cuſtody. Wherefore, to this ende, and for this cauſe <hi>Luke</hi> dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  </gap>ſe which had ſeene with their Eyes from the beginninge thoſe thinges which were done by the Lorde, and were ſome parte of thoſe thinges which they declared. But why theſe two writte their Goſpells after <hi>Mathew,</hi> or <hi>Mathew</hi> after theſe two, when as notwithſtandinge the whole three ſhewe one thing, this ſeemeth to be the more likely cauſe, for that they wrote them in diuers countreys, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame farre diſtante one from another, in ſo much that the one hadde no hope that the writinges of the other woulde come vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Countrey where he was. For who neede to doubt but that they, which from the beginning knew &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode by Fayth theſe wonderfull Ieſts and moſt wholſome wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde, appoynted their Preachers to put the ſame in writinge, leaſte any of them ſhoulde bee forgotten: and ſo by this meanes other Goſples were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to other ſome? The which occaſion Sathan by and by takinge, thruſt in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alſo his Euangeliſtes into the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which tooke vpon them to write the ſayinges and deedes of the Lorde, but mingled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all their owne dreames and Imaginations. Whereby it came to paſſe (as the Nature of man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wont more to fancy the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of men, the which thinge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighte it ſelfe which is alwayes taken of Fables, Tales, Pageants, and ſuch like vaine Fantaſies, manifeſtly prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) that many preferring Lyes before the truth, forged vnto themſelues a ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned Chriſte. And thus a booke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Infancy of our Sauiour was receiued of many, with many other goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pells and writings, not only Apocrifa, but alſo very pernicious; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the godly Byſhops afterwards had no light co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tencion. This miſchiefe began to take place in <hi>Lukes</hi> time: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſeeinge that neyther the Goſpells of <hi>Mathewe,</hi> nor of <hi>Marke</hi> were in that Region, was moued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of truth and ſincere Chryſtianiſme to write y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell, by which, not ſo much this <hi>Theophilus</hi> (to whom ſpecially he wrote the ſame) as others alſo, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting trifells, might haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> certainty of thoſe thinges, concerninge which they

were taught. Therefore the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth here <hi>(For ſo much as many haue taken in hand)</hi> As they which haue wrytten Goſpells in the names of <hi>Bartholmew,</hi> of <hi>Andrew,</hi> of <hi>Nicodeme,</hi> of <hi>Mathie,</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <hi>C.</hi> Hee ſeemeth heere to alleage the cauſe of his writinge, which ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue ſtayed him from writing. For to write a new which was hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led already of many, was a ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe labour, if ſo be they had faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly done their duety. But he doth not ſo much as in one woorde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them eyther of deceipte, or of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or of any other faſt: therefore in effect his wordes are as much as if hee ſhould ſay that hee will do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is already done. To this we au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere.</p>
               <p>That although hee ſpareth others which had written before, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he doth not altogether allow their labor. Hee doth not expreſly ſay they had written of doubtfull thinges: but challenging vnto him ſelfe the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of matters, modeſtly derogateth from them ſure and vndoubted credit. If any man obiect and ſay, that it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther became him ſharply to inueygh, if ſo bee they diſceyued; Wee aunſwere agayne, that it might bee that their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was not great, which was rather committed of raſhe zeale than of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe wickedneſſe: and that therefore there was no cauſe why hee ſhould ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently reproue them. And it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were onely certayne ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and profers, which beinge at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time not greatly hurtfull, had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde done more harme to the fayth, if ſo be they had not bene prouided for in tyme.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is profitable to noate, that God which prouided this remedy by <hi>Luke</hi> for ſuperfluouſe writings, by his wonderfull counſayle broughte to paſſe, that others beinge by publique conſent reiected, theſe only might haue credit, in whom his reuerend maieſty perfectly ſhyned. Whereby their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is leſſe tollerable, which do now ſet forth vnto the whole Worlde wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodly fables, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> or of any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(To ſet forth in order) E.</hi> He v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this phraſe of ſpeach, becauſe ſom others had ſet forth certayne thinges vnperfectly gleaninge heere and there and not proſecutinge any thinge at the full. Yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euangeliſt <hi>Mathew</hi> him ſelfe, although hee bee more plentifull than the reſt, and beginneth with the very Natiuity of Chriſte like a Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer, yet notwithſtandinge hee hath pretermitted almoſt all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chyld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, and youth of Chriſte.

Wherefore <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> gieueth vnto <hi>Luke</hi> a Hyſtoricall or peculier ſtyle.

And, if this happened to Zacharias at the ſight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angell, to whom the prayſe of ryghteouſneſſe is geuen, the which Angell is but a ſpark of the deuine light: What ſhal become of vs miſerable men if ſo be the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God appeare vnto vs at the full? Thus wee are taught by the example of the holy Fathers, that none haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feelinge of Gods preſence, but they which feare and tremble at the ſight of him: and that they are very blockiſhe and dull which careleſly neglecte his voyce.

               <p>Therefore <hi>Iohanan,</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> ſignifieth gratious and accepted, who in deede was moſt acceptable, whom in deede God had choſen to ſo notable an office of the Goſpell with ſo great myracles.

               <p>Becauſe the name of peace is very plauſible and acceptable, ſo often as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is named in the Scripture, the Papiſts greedily take holde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to make vs hated: as though that wee which goe about to bring the Worlde from defection vnto Chriſte, were the authors of diſcorde.

               <p>The Lord no doubte ſawe ſome worſe matter in Zacharias, than his wordes ſeeme to importe: and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him becauſe by diſtruſt hee reiected the grace promyſed vnto him. It is not our parte to teach God what he ſhall doe, but to geue him leaue to punyſh that in one whych he forgeueth in another. But it doth eaſely appere that there is great dyfference betwene the cauſe of Zacharias, and the cauſe of <hi>Abraham, Gedeon,</hi> or <hi>Mary.</hi> The whych dyfference can not be perceyued in the woordes.

For they do to ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and wickedly Iudge of the workes of God, which thinke that hee will doe no more, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is lyke by nature to come to paſſe as though hys power were ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubiect to our ſenee, or ſhut &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in earthly meanes.

Therefore when we doe not aſſuredly ſtay our ſelues vpon the worde of God, wee are condemned of infidellity: becauſe fayth cannot ſtand wythout aſſurance: and where doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, there is incredulity. We ought of this only to reaſon with our ſelues, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde hath ſpoken it or no: that wee ſhoulde examine the truth of hys words: (for that were dyueliſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety) but only to the ende that when it is manyfeſt that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath ſpoken we might in nothing doubt. But if Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias had doubted of the Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from whence it came, it had bene no ſigne of vnbeliefe. <hi>C.</hi> But he doubted not whether it were the voyce of God yea or no, but leaning to much vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Worlde, an ouerthwarte doubt crept into his minde, whether that which he had heard ſhould come to paſſe. And herein he did no ſmal iniury vnto God, becauſe it was as much as if hee had diſputed wyth him ſelfe, whether God were to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted true, whom he was ſure had ſpoken. Howbeit wee muſte know that Zacharias was ſo vnbeliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, that hee ſwarued quite from the Fayth. For there is a generall Fayth whyth taketh holde of the promyſe of eternall ſauation, and of the teſtimony of free Adoption. And as after that God hath once receyued vs into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, he doth make many ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes vnto vs, as that he wil feede vs, delyuer vs from perills, defend our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and preſerue our lyfe: ſo there is alſo a certayne ſpeciall fayth which agreeth to euery one of theſe Promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Therefore ſome tyme it commeth to paſſe that one truſting in God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Remiſſion of ſinnes, and his ſaluation, ſhall in ſome parte doubte. For eyther hee ſhall doubt to much in the perill of death, or els will be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1180:53"/>
carefull for daily foode, eyther will be to doubtful in his Counſayles. Such was the incredulity of Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, becauſe he holding faſt the roote &amp; foundation of fayth, doubted onely in one parte, as, whether GOD would geue him a Sonne. Wherefore let vs know that they doe not quite fall away from the Fayth, who in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Buſineſſe are troubled wyth their owne infirmity, and that faith doth not quyte fall from the roote, ſo often as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boughes thereof are ſhaken wyth the wynde.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it may be that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe of Zacharias was nothyng leſſe than to bring the fayth and truth of the deuine promyſe into queſtion: but being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded after a ſorte that God is true, was ſecretly drawen by the malice and crafte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuill into a wicked diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And the Aungell doth that thing here, which God himſelfe is wonte to doe in diuers places of the ſcripture: Namely when by a general doctryne he confirmeth a particuler Promyſe.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge Shee ſayth expreſly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God remembred his mercy: the which hee might ſeeme after a ſort to haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in ſufferinge his People ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to bee vexed &amp; afflicted.

an abſurde alteration of the caſe. For it ought rather to haue bene ſayd, <hi>To Abraham and his ſeede.</hi> But it is not a ſimple appoſition: Bycauſe Marye doth not only ſhewe who thoſe fathers were to whom God ſpake: but doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo extend the force and the effect of the Promiſes to all the Poſterity, which were the naturall ſeede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Whereupon alſo it followeth that ſhe ſpeaketh of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſolemne couenant, which was ſpecially made with Abraham, &amp; his Poſterity.

                  <hi>C.</hi> But there aryſeth a far greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, &amp; doubt of another place. For <hi>Ioſephus</hi> affyrmeth in his <hi>18.</hi> Booke of Antiquities, the firſt Chapter, that <hi>Quirinus,</hi> when <hi>Archelaus</hi> was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into <hi>Vienna,</hi> was Liefetenaunte, who aſſigned <hi>Iudea</hi> to the Prouince of <hi>Syria.</hi> For all Wrighters doe agree, that <hi>Archelaus</hi> raigned nine yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of his Father, <hi>Herod.</hi> Whereupon it followeth that betwen the Birth of Chriſte, and that Taxe, there were about thirtene yeares. For all men ſubmit themſelues to <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nius</hi> Iudgement, who affirmeth that Chriſte was borne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> three and thirtith yeare of Herods raigne, that is to ſay, foure yeares before his death.</p>
               <p>This alſo is ſome what intricate &amp; doubtfull, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame Ioſephus hath in his <hi>18.</hi> Booke and third Chapter: where hee ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this Taxe was made in the <hi>37.</hi> yeare after the towne <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> in <hi>Epyre</hi> was wonne. The which if it bee true, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſuruiued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeuen yeares longer. And ſo eight or nine yeares of his Age ſhalbe demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For it will appere by the third Chapt. of Luke that he was then but fifteene yeares olde.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the age of Chriſte is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould be drawen in queſtion, it is very likely that Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus erred in this point, as in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo. And in deede the Cronicles ſhew that <hi>Quirinius</hi> was Conſull <hi>19.</hi> yeares or there aboutes, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> had ouercome <hi>Antonius,</hi> and raigned alone: ſo hee ſhould be a very olde man when he was ſent to gouerne the Prouince. Moreouer, the ſame Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus reckoneth vp foure Liefeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes of Iury within the compaſſe of eight yeares: when as he confeſſeth that <hi>Quintus</hi> was Liefetnaunt eleuen yeares. The ſame was <hi>Valerius Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> whom <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, another ſolution may bee brought, that it was not lawfull by &amp; by to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Taxe in hand, after it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. For Ioſephus ſheweth that <hi>Coponius</hi> was ſent with an army to repreſſe the Iewes. Whereby wee may eaſely gather that the Taxe was let for a time by the Tumult of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and the Woordes of Luke beare this, that there went forth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement about the time of Chriſtes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity, to Taxe the People: and a taxe could not be made without the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kingdome, ſeeing that Iury was made a part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince. And ſo this latter parte ſhalbe added in ſteede of correction. <hi>This firſt taxing was made, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Cyrenius was Liefetenaunt:</hi> That is to ſay, then it was brought to effect and not before.</p>

But let vs remember, that they ſo ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle preuayle, that at the lengthe they are cruſhed and broken to pieces.

                  <hi>(And vpryſing agayne.) S.</hi> That is to ſay to be an occaſion of vpryſinge, &amp; of Saluation.

                  </hi> It is certaine that there were neuer two high Prieſts in the prieſthoode at one time.

At what time that Pilate was Liefetenaunt of Iury, wee reade not in Ioſephus that any alteration was made by him. Yea when hee was put from the Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and place, and was commaunded to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> to anſwere his cauſe: then <hi>Vitellius</hi> Liefetenaunt of <hi>Syria,</hi> depriuinge <hi>Caiphas,</hi> aduaunced <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Anani</hi> to the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode. And, whereas Luke nameth two high Prieſtes, wee may not ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, as though hee gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them both all one tytell: but hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth two, bycauſe one halfe of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Prieſtehoode, remained to <hi>Annas</hi> the high Prieſtes Father in Lawe. Wherefore Luke geueth vs to vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſtate was ſo confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; diſordered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were was at that time no one true high Prieſte: but that the holy prieſthood was rent and torne by ambition, and tyrannical power. Concerning <hi>Caiphas,</hi> reade the <hi>26.</hi> Chap. of Mathew and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde verſe. <hi>(The worde of the Lord came to Ihon)</hi> This Hebrewe Phraſe of ſpeache is very common in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>The woorde of the Lord came to Oſee, to Zachary,</hi> and to others: that is to ſay. The Lorde ſpake vnto them, and appointed them by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement to their office: bycauſe no man ought to vſurpe an office to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for that were great raſhneſſe.</p>
               <p>Such did nothinge of them ſelues but by Gods appointment. <hi>C.</hi> Therefore Luke, before hee ſhew that Ihon tooke his office in hande, declareth that hee was called vnto the ſame by God, that his miniſtery mighte ſufficiently bee warranted vnto vs by authority.</p>
               <p>Hereby wee gather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none are true Teachers, but they which are called vnto their office by God. For it is not ſufficient to haue the worde of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there bee Ioyned vnto the ſame a ſpeciall callinge.

                  <hi>C.</hi> This forne of ſpeach doth firſt of all generally ſhew, which is the right vſe of the ſacraments. Secondly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſme is inſtituted, and what it contayneth. A Sacrament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not a dumbe Ceremony, which ſheweth forth ſome goodly ſhew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doctrine: but it hath the Word of God annexed thereunto, which quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the externall Ceremony it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>When wee ſpeake of the Worde, wee meane not that Word, which ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſte by magicall whiſperings, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth, but which is pronounced with a loude and diſtincte voice, to the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Faith. For Iohn is not ſayd ſimply to baptize into repentaunce, as though the Grace of God were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a viſible Signe: but to preache what the profit of baptiſme was, that of the worde preached there might be an effectuall ſigne. And this is proper vnto baptiſme, that it is ſayd to bee a ſigne of repentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes. <hi>S.</hi> Here therefore wee ſee that Baptiſme is a ſigne of Renouation.</p>
               <p>For men were inuited to repentance y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might bee new Creatures.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this Sacrament is called the Baptiſme of Repentaunce of his ende: not that the externall ſigne is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to repentance (for Hypocrits do ſufficiently ſhew how farre a ſunder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, and the figure are) but here firſt of all the Inſtitution of GOD is reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, then the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt, vpon the which, dependeth the effecte of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, there are two thinges to be conſidered of vs: the Promiſe by which GOD teſtifieth that of ſtoany hearts hee will make hearts of fleſhe: the which hee ſealeth and confirmeth by Baptiſme: Then Exhortacion by which they that receiue Baptiſme are taught, to liue truly according to their profeſſion. <hi>C.</hi> Now, ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iohns Baptiſme agreeth with ours, in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, in force, and in reaſon, if the Figure be Iudged and wayghed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth thereof, it is falſe that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Iohn and of Chriſte were not all one.

For Kings, when they are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receiued, haue their way with great care and dilligence prepared for them: Whatſoeuer is high is made playne and euen, whatſoeuer is low is filled vp, that it may bee leuell: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that which is Crooked, is made ſtraite.</p>

               <p>For although GOD did then migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely declare his Grace, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge hee did not reueale his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole Worlde.

               <p>Note alſo how often the Scripture maketh mencion of the ſpirit of God, and ſaith that the ſame dwelleth in vs, leaſt thou ſhouldeſt conſider any voyde or vayne thinge, but rather his power and efficacie. So that after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had ſpoken of the ſpirite of God, hee addeth vnction, by which the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Spirie of God are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode.

For no man can take vnto him Right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to teach in the Church of God, except hee can ſhew that hee was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there unto by the ſpirite of God.</p>
               <p>And wee ſhall knowe who are ſent of God, by the anoyntinge: (that is to ſay) if hee bee indued with theſe giftes which are required to that Function: if, hee beinge appointed of the Lord, hath in him the Graces of the ſpirite, then hee hath in deede the holy Ghoſt. But if a man hauinge no doctrine, or learninge at all will profeſſe himſelfe to be a maiſter and a Teacher, let him bee accounted for a deceiuer.</p>

               <p>This was a Ciuill Lawe moſt fit for the Land of Canaan, and neceſſary for the gouernment of the Iewes.

For if thou bee hee which healeſt the broken in heart, which deliuereth all men from their vnhappineſſe and maketh them happy, why doeſt thou not firſt of all &amp; eſpecially ſhewe thy power vppon thy owne Citizens, and Kinſfolke?</p>

                  <hi>C.</hi> By theſe wordes of Chriſt we may caſty gather, that hee was contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly receiued of the Nazarites: for hee bewrayeth that which they thought in their heartes: Then hee layeth the blame vpon themſelues, in that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned from ſhewinge Myracles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them: and hee reproueth their wickedneſſe, in that they geue no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to the Lords Prophet.</p>
               <p>The obiection which hee preuenteth is thus, It is no meruaile if countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue him in no Eſtimation and price, ſeeinge hee did not honour his owne Countrey with myracles, as hee did other Places: Wherefore this is Iuſt vengeaunce if hee bee reiected of his owne, whom hee leſſe regardeth then any other. And this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the common Prouerbe, that the Phiſition ſhoulde firſte begin to Cure him ſelfe &amp; his, before he take in hand to cure any others. The ſumme of the obiection is, that Chriſt did prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, in making other Cities of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile famouſe with Myracles, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his owne Countrey. And this ſeemed to the Nazarites an honeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, why they in like maner might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte him.</p>

               <p>Many are led and carried by a feruent zeale: but if the Wyſedome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite be wantyng, they burſt forth into foming Rage. It commeth alſo often times to paſſe that the Affections of the Fleſhe are myxed wyth a boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous zeale, and that they which ſeeme to be moſt ielouſe of the Glory of God are blynded with pryuate Affection of the Fleſh.</p>

                  <hi>R.</hi> If a man receyue hurte of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he thinketh it Equity and right to doe Iniurye agayne, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</p>
               <p>Another curſſeth his Aduerſarie, another wiſheth to his Ennemy not onely Death, but alſo an infinite ſorte of Deuils and Hell fire it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And as theſe Thynges are done, ſo ſometime they are thought to be iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done. And why ſo? For (ſay they) he hurt me firſt. Why ſhould hee doe vnto me ſuch iniury, who haue don no harme but good?

               <p>But how worthy ſoeuer wee be of our meate, workinge in the harueſt of the Father, who will geue the ſame vnto vs?

And, bycauſe all men for the moſt parte are ſo proude, that they will not willingly ſubmit them ſelues vnto their Equalls: and agayne, God hath Determyned to Gouerne hys

his Church by the Myniſtery of men, and to chooſe often times to the myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his worde the moſt baſe ſorte of men: it was neceſſary that hee ſhoulde defend the maieſty of the Goſple, leaſt comming out of mans mouth, it ſeeme vile and baſe. This therefore is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the externall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, when Chriſt pronounceth that what honour and reuerence ſoeuer is geuen vnto mans preaching (ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame be faithfull) is geuen to GOD him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And the profite of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſteth of two pointes: For there is nothinge that oughte to animate vs more to imbrace the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, than when we heare that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame is the moſt exellent worſhip of God, &amp; a ſacrifice of a ſweete ſmell, we heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him then ſpeaking in the mouth of men. Secondly all doubtinge is taken away, when we heare that the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our ſaluation is neuer a whit the worſe, when the ſame is geuen by men which are ſent of God, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is of as great priſe euen as if his voyce ſhould ſound from heauen. And contrarywiſe to terrefie the contemners of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, hee pronounceth that they which will not heare his myniſters bee they neuer ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temtible, are contumelious not to men, but to God the Father him ſelfe. For he ſayth, <hi>And he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you deſpiſeth mee] A</hi> So alſo ſayth the Apoſtell Paule:<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.8</note> 
                  <hi>Hee which reiecteth theſe thinges, reiecteth not man, but God, which hath geuen his holy ſpirite in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> And as the dignity of Paſtors is here greatly extolled, which ſincerely and faithfully execute their office: So is the Pope with his miniſters made ridiculouſe, when by this place he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to defende his tiranny. For it is certaine that Chriſt doth not ſo ſpeake here, that he doth reſigne his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty geuen him of his father vnto men, but only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might deliuer his Goſple from contempt. Whereuppon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the honour due vnto him is not geuen vnto men, but reſerued only vnto his worde.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the Pope will be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, let him bring that doctrine in the which he may be knowen to be the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſte.

               <p>Alſo, ſeeing the ſonne of God cannot be deceiued, and ſeeinge this his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of the which hee ſpeaketh here, belongeth to the continuall race of the Goſpell: there is no doubt, ſo often as hee rayſeth vp faithfull Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, but that he will geue fruitfull ſucceſſe vnto their laboure.

C.</hi> This hiſtory teacheth vs, that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoeuer Chriſte came, hee did not ſeeke him ſelfe, or his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity and eaſe, but had alwayes a ſpeciall care to profit others, and to diſcharge the Office which the Father had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him. For Luke ſheweth that ſo ſoone as hee was receiued of Martha, he gaue himſelfe to teaching and to exhorting. <hi>A.</hi> And Mary ſitting at his feete heard his word.<note place="margin">Loue in Chriſt yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and faith in vs receiueth heauenly doctrine.</note> Wherein wee haue an example of a thirſty faith, and a burninge loue, yeeldinge in the one, &amp; receiuing in the other heauenly thinges.</p>

                  <hi>40. <hi>But Martha was combred aboute much ſeruinge, and came to hym, and ſayd, Lord doeſt thou not care, that my Syſter hath lefte mee to ſerue alone? Bid her therefore that ſhee help mee.</hi>

                  <hi>Martha was cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred about much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge] C.</hi> Bycauſe this place hath bene foulely wreſted to the prayſe of a contemplatiue lyfe, (as they call it) we muſt vnderſtand the true ſence and meaning of the ſame, whereby it ſhall appeare that the purpoſe of Chriſte was nothinge leſſe, than to appoynte his Diſciples to liue Idelly, &amp; in colde ſpeculations</p>
               <p>This is an olde error, They leade an Angells life, which being not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with buſineſſe, geue them ſelues wholly to contemplation. And it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Papiſtes haue drawen this error from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> who placeth the chiefe Felicity, and the laſt ende of mans life, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation. But ſome beinge ledde by Ambition, and other ſome by Idleneſſe to liue ſolitarily in Cloyſters, this pride hath alſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they will be like Angels in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing. For they deſpiſe a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge Life as much, as if it did pull backe from Heauen. But wee know that men were created to this end, that they ſhould exerciſe them ſelues in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and that there are no Sacrifices more acceptable vnto God, than for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to liue in his callinge, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablely for a common wealth. But how ignorantly they haue abuſed the Wordes of Chriſte to proue their lie, it may eaſely appeare by the ſimple ſence. Luke ſayth that Mary ſate at Ieſus feete. Doth hee meane thinke you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee did nothing elſe all her lyfe time? The Lord doth rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund vs ſo to deuide our time, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which will profite in the Schoole of Chriſte, muſt not bee continuall and ſlouthfull hearers, but muſt put that in vſe and practiſe which they haue learned. For there is a time to heare, and a time to worke. Very fooliſhly therefore doe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes interpret this place, as though Chriſt did here compare a ſpeculatiue life, with an actiue and workinge life: when as Chriſte ſimplely ſheweth to what end and how he will be receiued. For although the hoſpitallity of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha were prayſe worthy, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſte noteth two vices in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. The firſt is, bycauſe ſhee excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in cumbring her ſelfe. For Chriſte woulde rather haue bene entertayned with meane Charge and coſt, than to haue had the holy Matrone ſo much troubled. The ſecond is, bycauſe ſhee troublinge &amp; occupying herſelfe with ſuperfluouſe laboures, made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt vnprofitable. For this was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if one receiuing a prophet honorably, ſhould not care to here him but ſhould bury all the Docrine with great and ſuperfluous prouiſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord doeſt thou not care] C.</hi> Here alſo was another euell, that Martha pleaſing her ſelfe in her troubleſome worke, contemned the godly deſier to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1180:139"/>
learne in her ſiſter. Thus alwayes our vertues haue one ſpot or other, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that nothing is perfectly ſincere in vs. Martha truely is worthy of prayſe for receiuinge Chriſte: but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee eſteemed ſo much of her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, that ſhee preferred the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the godly deſier of her ſiſter, ſhee was to blame.</p>
               <p n="41">
                  <hi>41. <hi>And Ieſus anſwered and ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, Martha, Martha, thou arte carefull and troubled about many thinges. Verely one is needefull.</hi>

For Chriſte had another meaninge, namely, that what ſoeuer the faithfull take in hand to doe, there is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding but one marke, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which all thinges muſt be referred. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſumme is this, that wee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weary our ſelues in vaine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wee direct all our actions vnto a ſure and certaine faith.

And yet Chriſte doth not meane, that this one thing excepted, al other things are not to be waighed, but that we muſt with wiſdome obſerue an order.</p>
               <p>A notable ſentence verely, by which we are taught ſo to order and direct al the duties and partes of our life, that we may ſerue God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mary hath choſen the good parte] C.</hi> There is no compariſon here, as many Interpreters dreame: but only Chriſte pronounceth that Mary is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant and buſied with a very holy &amp; profitable ſtudy, from the which She ought not to be drawen. As if hee had ſayd, Thou mighteſt rightely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend thy Siſter, if ſo be ſhee being I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, or occupied with vayne Cares, ſhoulde laye the whole burthen of the worke vpon thee. But now, ſeeing ſhe hath well and profitably geuen herſelfe to heare, it is not meete to drawe her from the ſame: for ſhe ſhall not alway haue ſuch oportunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which ſhall not be taken away from her] C.</hi> There are ſome which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this part ſo, as though Chriſt ſhould therefore ſay that Mary had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the good parte, bycauſe the fruite of heauenly Doctrine ſhall neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. The which ſence is not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. Howbeit the other which wee brought before, more agreeth with the minde of Chriſte: as, that Mary was occupied in a holy and profitable ſtudy, from the which ſhe ought not to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

This Woman thought this to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt bleſſedneſſe, bycauſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had caried him in her Wombe: but that ſhee accounted to be the greateſt, was the leaſt. Wee ought to magnifie that, but there are greater thinges to be preferred. All the benefits of God, be they neuer ſo ſmall, are to be extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but yet not ſo as that wee make them equall to the greateſt. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we ought to magnifie God for our corporall Foode in this lyfe: But if wee ſo ſtand vpon this that wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the benefit of our illumination, of our Redemption and the gyft of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtinge Lyfe, wee doe very fondly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore that which this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thoughte to bee the chiefeſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Mary, was the leaſt: for it was a thinge of greater exellency for her to be gouerned with the ſpirite of Chriſt, then to conceiue the fleſhe of Chriſt in her Wombe: to haue Chriſte lyuing in her ſpiritually, then, to geeue him ſucke with her Pappes. To be ſhort, the glory and felicity of the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin conſiſted in this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee was made a member of her ſonne, that ſhe might be a new creature before God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Howbeit for another cauſe and to another ende Chriſt ſeemeth to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the voice of this Woman, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bycauſe ſhe omitted that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſe of Chryſte which was the principall parte, how that in him ſaluation was offered vnto all men. Therefore that was a colde praiſe in the which there was no mencion made of his praiſe &amp; vertue. Wherefore not without cauſe, Chriſte challengeth another prayſe to him ſelfe, leaſt his mother only might be accounted bleſſed, but that the ſame alſo might be by him exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto vs. <hi>That heare the word of God &amp; keepe it] C.</hi> But why holding his peace of him ſelfe doth hee make mencion onely

of the Woorde of God? Surely, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this meanes, hee openeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs all his treaſures: bycauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Woorde, neyther hath hee any thing to do with vs, nor wee with him. Seeing therefore he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate himſelfe with vs by the worde, he doth rightly and properly cal vs to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſame, that he may be made ours by fayth. Now we ſee what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of Chriſt differeth from the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation of the Woman. For he libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally offereth to all men that Grace of bleſſedneſſe, which ſhe had ſhut vp in a corner: and he teacheth that men muſt not Iudge of him after a common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: bycauſe, he contayneth in him ſelf all the Treaſures of heauenly Lyfe, of glory, and of bleſſedneſſe, the which he diſpenſeth by the worde, that they may be partakers of them which by Fayth imbrace the worde.

their Error by that Example. For if they had ſeene him to deuide Inhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunces, the rumor thereof ſhoulde by and by haue bene ſpread abroade. So in like maner many looked for a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Redemption, the which they too earneſtly deſired: the wicked boaſted that he went about to make a chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, and to pull away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaine Empyre.

Wherefore Chriſte woulde not haue all thynges mixte, and confounded. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is ſpirituall, &amp; the politicall gouernment pertayneth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon life of men.

               <p>There was alſo a <hi>3.</hi> particuler cauſe, namely bycauſe Chriſt ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this man leauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of God, had reſpect vnto his domeſticall profite.

Chryſt with this Sermon comforteth theyr care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cogitation, and exhorteth them to ſet aſide this carefulnes: to the whych Exhortation hee addeth very ſtronge Arguments by which he ſheweth that it is not onely ſuperfluous, but alſo great vnbeliefe to be carefull for fode and Apparell, as to forſake Godds calling, and to follow the deſires of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fleſh.

                  <hi>C.</hi> There is great wiſedome in thys Circumſtance which is expreſſed by <hi>Luke</hi> only, becauſe that the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly any one runneth into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of his Lord, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more grieuous puniſhment he is worthy of.

And it is to bee remembred that they which are made gouerners of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church do not ſin of ignoraunce, but do Wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wickedly offend their Lord. Notwithſtanding hereof a Generall Doctrine may be gathered, that men do in vayne ſeeke to excuſe themſelues by ignoraunce, to deliuer themſelues from the guiltineſſe of Sinne. For if ſo bee mortall men challenge thys to themſelues, that theyr Seruauntes ought to enquyre and ſeeke what their maiſters will is, leſt they do any thing out of order at home: how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority belongeth to the Sonne of God, that they which ſerue him ought to ſeke to he taught concerning his Commaundementes? And that they ought not at theyr owne pleaſure to take vncertaine Workes in hande, but to depende wholly vppon his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?

               <p>Wherefore, the more plentifully wee are taught, the more matter of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is increaſed, except to the ſame be ioyned Docillity and Obedience. Wherby it appeareth how friuolous theyr Obſtinacie is, which reiectynge the playne Doctrine of the Goſpell at this Day, do excuſe the ſame by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce of the Fathers: as though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Buckler of Ignoraunce were ſufficy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to repel the Iudgement of God.

               <p>Secondly, that it is appoynted to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, where, and when hee ſhall dye. Wherefore wee muſt with bouldneſſe and dilligence goe forward with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord.

               <p>Let no man therefore depende vpon the glorious ſhew of the place or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or meaſure the truth thereby. In the whole Worlde there was no place more holy that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> City of Hieruſalem, there was the temple, there was the ſanctuary of dyuine worſhip, there the Lord had promiſed his ſpecial preſence in this he would ſpecially be worſhyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,

For Chryſtians labour not for a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory buildinge, or for a momentany triumph.</p>
               <p>But where as Chriſte ſayth, that if a Kinge bee not able to Encounter wyth his enemy, ſeeketh peace, leaſte hee bee ouercome to his Ignominy &amp; Shame, it ought not to be applyed to the preſent cauſe, as though we ſhould haue any reconciliation wyth our ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Enemy if wee bee not able to match him: For it were fond to ſtraine all thinges in Parables to the matter which is in hande. But the Lord mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſimplely, that wee ought to be ſo appoynted, leaſt wee being founde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, tourne our Backes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte.

               <p>Many, bycauſe they are not by &amp; by deliuered oute of Pryſon, abandon all Pacience, and forſake their courſe: for they cannot abyde to be Chriſtians vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they may be free from the Croſſe.

bycauſe they are conuerſant in inſtructing the vnlearned. But there was manyfeſt cauſe why Chriſte kept company with Publicans &amp; Synners, namely, that hee might leade them as it were by the hande from their ſinnes to righteouſneſſe. And this was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſt that none could deny it. But the Phariſies were ſo Enuious againſte Chriſte, that what ſoeuer he did well, they miſconſtrued and miſlyked.

                  <hi>C.</hi> Here the ſubtill enemyes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth Cauill, and ſay, that God is preuented by Repentance. This were true, it ſo be Repentance came of our ſelues, and were not the gyft of God. For ſeeinge the whole Scripture ſayth, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the fruite of a new heart: and a new heart co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of God; what meane they to attribute that vnto men which belongeth onely vnto GOD?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of God, except repentance goe before. But God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth and worketh in vs this wyſe. For in reſpect of him Remiſſion goeth before, and after that, Repentance fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in vs: but in reſpect of vs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance muſt needes go before: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee cannot apprehend the mercy of God. <hi>C.</hi> Therefore wee muſt note that the hope of better fortune, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Father, incouraged the younge man to repent. For no ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Puniſhmentes, can ſtay vs from our wickedneſſe, or can make vs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like our ſinnes, vntill ſome profite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Therefore as this yonge man is encouraged vpon truſte of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mercy, to ſeeke a reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilliation; euen ſo vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feelinge of Gods mercy muſt be vnto vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of repentance, which ſtirreth vs vp to hope well.</p>

For hee did meditate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this meane in himſelfe, not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to deceiue his Father, but to moue him to compaſſion. <hi>I haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt Heauen]</hi> Beholde here how that the ſubiection, &amp; obedience due to the Father, is appoynted of God.

their ſinnes muſt alſo confeſſe them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: and that is a ſure ſigne of true humillity. The confeſſion ought to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Offence. When men are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy to our ſinnes, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe our ſinnes alſo before them: otherwiſe we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe to God alone, if we offend him alone. For the confeſſion muſt be eſteemed by the nature of the faulte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne] R.</hi> It doth not only ſuffice to acknowledge ſinne, but wee muſt alſo haue ſuch a feeling of ſinne in our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If men, which are by nature deſierouſe of vengeance, may notwithſtandinge bee moued to bende and yeelde by fatherly pitty, gently to pardon their ſonnes, &amp; willingly to require them being miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably loſt, God, whoſe exceeding good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe excelleth all the loues of fathers, will be no more ſeuere toward vs. And verely there is nothing ſpoken here of an earthly Father, which God doth not promiſe concerning him ſelfe.</p>

If ſo bee wee deſier to bee counted the ſonnes of God, we muſt brotherly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue our brethren their faultes, euen as hee fatherly forgeueth both them, &amp; vs. <hi>S.</hi> Notwithſtanding ſome haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted this place, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Iewes were figured in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Elder brother.</p>
               <p>The which figure doth not ſounde amiſſe, bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes are as it were the firſt begotten in the Church: and we know how proudly they diſdayned the calling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles. <hi>C.</hi> But they which do thus expound it doe not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently waigh the order of the texte. For the talke began by the murmuring of the Scribes, who were offended that Chriſte ſhould ſhew ſo much humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towardes miſerable and contemned men. Therefore he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scribes which were ſo puffed vp with arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to modeſt men, who haue honeſtly, and thriftely in their life, ordered their affayres: and to obedient ſonnes, who haue all their life time paciently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelues to their fathers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. And although they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnworthy of this prayſe, yet notwithſtanding Chriſte ſpeaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſence, imputeth vnto their fayned holineſſe, for a vertue, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſſion: as if he had ſayd, Although I graunt vnto you that which yee falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſte, that yee haue bene alway o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient ſonnes vnto God, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding yee ought not ſo proudly and arrogantly to reiect your Bretheren, when they repent them of their wicked and daungerous lyfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> Therefore Hypocrites cannot abide that ſo large mercy ſhould bee offered vnto the people of God. And Chriſte attributed this parſon to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodneſſe of GOD might be the better expreſſed. For if ſo be the firſt begotten had ſinned, by and by, a man might haue thought, that GOD doth not pardon others as he doth the firſt begotten. Therefore in this, the goodneſſe of God is more greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Often times wee ſee that the Elder are forſaken, and the Younger are choſen.</p>
               <p>Thus the Purpoſe of Chriſte was to reiect the Iudgement of the fleſh. Howbeit, this moſt commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that as the Eldeſt Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren haue the preheminence, ſo Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites haue moſte Authority in the Church.</p>

                  <hi>R.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chapter going before, Chriſt in three Parables reprehendeth the Hypocriſie, and vayne holyneſſe of the Scribes, and Phariſies, by which, in compariſon of them ſelues they diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all other Synners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>C.</hi> And now he teacheth by another ſimilitude, that we ought to behaue our ſelues louing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly &amp; courteouſly towardes our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures: that when wee ſhall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunall Seate of God, the fruite of our liberallity may redounde vnto vs. And although it ſeemeth to be a hard and farre fecht Similitude, yet notwithſtanding it may eaſely appeare that Chriſte had no other meaning. Alſo hereby wee perceiue, that they make a fonde interpretation, which in Parables ſcrupulouſly diſcuſſe euery poynte. For Chryſt doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de here to redeeme or to make ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with gyftes, for deceiptes, for extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and prodigall ſpendinge, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euell faltes in diſpenſing: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God maketh vs Stewards of all his goods, which hee geueth vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, here is preſcribed vnto vs a way which ſhall eaſe vs of great Rigor in time to come when we muſt make our accounte. For they which Imagyne that Almes deedes will counteruayle luxury, and diſſolute lyfe, doe not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieiently way, that this is firſt of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vnto vs, that wee ſhould liue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and temperatly: ſecondly,<note place="margin">Pro. 5.15</note> that Ryuers myghte flowe vnto vs from a pure well.</p>
               <p>It is certaine that there is no man ſo thrifty, that doth not ſomtime waſte the goods committed vnto him: And therefore they which are moſt ſparing are not altogether free from waſtinge that which is committed them to vſe. For there are many wayes to abuſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyftes of God, that men in one thinge or other muſt needes offende.</p>
               <p>Alſo wee deny not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ought the more to ſtyrre vs vp to the dueties of Charity.

and that our humanity towardes the Bretheren, may prouoke the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God towarde vs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Chriſte doth not ſhewe here vnto his Dyſciples a way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may deliuer them ſelues from blame, when the heauenly Iudge ſhal require an accounte of them: but hee admoniſheth them to beware in tyme, leaſt they bee puniſhed for their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if they be founde waſters, or conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of the Lords goods vppon them ſelues, and to haue done no good work of liberallity.<note place="margin">Math. 7.2</note> For wee muſt alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that looke what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we meate to others, the ſame ſhal bee meaſured to vs agayne.</p>

Therefore Chriſt doth not preferre carnall Wyſedome before the Wyſedome of the Godly, ſeeing this commeth onely of the ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of GOD. For hee ſpeakeath not of the Wyſedome which the Spirite ſimplely gieueth vnto vs, but ſayth, that the Chyldren of this Worlde are more prouident for them ſelues in the thinges appertayninge to this worlde than are the Chyldren of GOD.</p>

               <p>Beholde, the Seruaunt in obaying his Bodely mayſter obayeth Chryſte the LORDE of Heauen alſo. For theſe two mayſters as touchinge thys matter agree together and requyre al one thinge. Chryſt commaundeth that the Seruaunt ſhould ſerue Faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to his callyng, the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doth the Carnall mayſter requyre. Chryſt commaundeth Seruauntes to obay theyr Bodely Mayſter wylling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodely mayſter requyreth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyke. Chryſte forbyddeth Seruaunts to do Eye ſeruice, the ſame doth the Bodely maiſter alſo forbyd, &amp; requyreth in the Seruaunt ſyncere and Faythful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. So IOSEPH ſerued GOD and the Kynge of <hi>Aegypte,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing he requyred nothing to be done whych was agaynſt GOD. But if two mayſters commaunde contrarie Thynges, and doe diſagree the one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other, there is no man whych can ſerue them both at once. Now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde our GOD and MAMMON are two mayſters whych are contrary the one to the other.</p>
               <p>They do not diſagree to their own nature becauſe Riches are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the good Creatures of GOD, but it commeth to paſſe by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men that Ryches are agaynſte GOD. Whereupoon it commeth to paſſe that GOD and <hi>Mammon</hi> commaund contrary thinges. For God eommaundeth to helpe the poore wyth our ryches, but <hi>Mammon</hi> being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the deſire of the Fleſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth ſo to hould faſt our Riches, that we parte not from one farthyng toward the reliefe of the poore. God commaundeth to lay vp for our ſelues Treaſures in Heauen where Ruſte and Moathe doe not corrupt, &amp; where Theeues do not breake throughe and ſteale: but <hi>Mammon</hi> commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to lay vp Treaſure in Earth. So that if we conſider the workes of both mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they are moſte contrary the one to the other. GOD worketh in man the Loue of our Neighbor. <hi>Mammon</hi> worketh hatred and enuy. God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the conſcience peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. <hi>Mammon</hi> ſtyrreth vp greate Debate and Vnquyetnes. GOD ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth increaſe to the word of the goſpel receiued through hearing. <hi>Mammon</hi> choaketh the hearing of the Worde of GOD. How can it be then that thou canſt ſerue them both.</p>
               <p>And wee muſt note that Chriſt ſayd not. No man can ſerue God and get Riches, but. <hi>(Yee can not ſerue God and Mammon)</hi> For the Godlie may get Ryches eyther by theyr Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce, or by theyr lawfull trauayle in theyr calling.

                  <hi>R.</hi> Moreouer wee haue ſet forthe in theſe Phariſes the diſpoſition of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrytes and couetous perſons. For when they deride Chryſte becauſe hee taught that no man coulde ſerue God Mammon, they ſhew that they iudge the Doctrine of Chryſt not onely to be be foliſh and vain but alſo pernicious for the common ſociety of men.

               <p>Furthermore the whole Wiſedom of the Worlde is generally condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For we muſt only haue reſpect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this that our Life may bee accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God.

               <p>But how ridiculouſe and fooliſh this ambition is, their ſoules which are in hell doe teſtefy. Wherefore wee haue heere a conſolation if ſo bee our deade Carcaſſes are not honourably buryed, or be caſt forth for wilde Beaſtes: For this did nothing at all hurte the poore man, no more than the expence &amp; coſte did profite the ryche man in his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.

For mens Soules haue not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Eyes, neyther are they thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, neither haue they mutuall talke one with another, as is here deſcribed betwene Abraham and the glutton: but the Lord maketh here a diſcription of the State of the Life to come, ſo farre forth as our vnderſtanding is able to comprehend. And the ſumme is this, that the ſoules of the faithfull, ſo ſoone as they departed from the bodies, liue a Ioyfull and bleſſed Lyfe out of the Worlde: but, that horible tormentes are prepared for the Reprobate, which are ſo greate that our myndes can no more conceiue them, than they can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For as in a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle parte only, ſo farre forth as we are illuminated by the ſpirite of God, wee taſte through hope, the glory promiſed vnto vs, which farre ſurmounteth all our ſences: ſo let it ſuffice vs to obſcure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the incomprehenſible vengeance of God which remayneth for the wicked, ſo farre as is neceſſary to make vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearde. Thus the words of Chriſte do geue vnto vs only a ſmall taſte of theſe things, and which ſerueth very well to bridell our curioſity, namely, that the wicked being very ſoare torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with the feeling of their miſery, deſire ſome ſolace: Notwithſtanding all hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut of, they feele a double torment: and that they are yet more tormented, when they are conſtrayned to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their owne wickedneſſe, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therefore thoſe corporal things which are heere wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the ſight a far of, the burning heate of the tongue, the cooling, the dippyng of the Finger in water, the Gulphe and ſuch like, are altogether Spyritually to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode.

The words of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham are thus much in effect: Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created to immortall life, and the Law of God lyfting thee vpwarde to meditate a heauenly Life, thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding ſo excellent a porcion, rather deſiredſt to be like a dogge or an hog, therefore thou receiuedſt a rewarde mete for brutiſh pleaſures. <hi>(And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Lazarus paynes) C.</hi> When as it is ſayd of <hi>Lazarus</hi> that hee enioyed Solace becauſe he ſuffered many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes in this world, we can not well draw the ſame to all miſerable perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s who haue ſo ſmally profited by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they haue ben rather brought by them vnto extreame puniſhmente: but the pacient bearing of the Croſſe is commended in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whych al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſpryngeth from Faith, and from the true Feare of God. For hee which doth ſtubbornely reſiſt euils deſerueth no prayſe of ſufferance that God may geue vnto him Solace and Ioy for the Croſſe. Therefore the ſumme is this, that they which patiently beare thys burthen layed vpon them, &amp; murmure not agaynſt Gods correction, but paſſe through all griefs to the hope of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life ſhall haue after the time of their warfare perpetual reſt in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and contrariwiſe, they which haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed the pleaſures of the Fleſh care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly contemning God ſhall paſſe from Death to Euerlaſting Torments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them,</p>

They fayne that they will beleue. For they are moued at a ſodayne, but they retourne by and by to theyr olde wont agayne. For Impiety cannot be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any reuelations. God hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently taught by his worde what is neceſſary to Saluation, and hee hathe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1180:175"/>
ſufficiently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed the ſame word to be beleued. For by how many miracles did hee approue the law? By how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo did he confirme the Doctryne of the Prophetes which followed the Law. At the laſt came Chryſte, who approued the doctrine with myracles and mighty ſignes. Furthermore God will worke effectually with his word. For Fayth doth not depend vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, but of the holy Ghoſt. It followeth then that Reuelations ſhall preuayle nothing. For we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the naked word, but as it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the holy Ghoſt. <hi>R.</hi> Wherefore we muſt not heare dead men, we muſt not looke for angels, neither muſt we harken after humane wiſedom, but we muſt heare <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophetes, that thereby we may profite and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto God.

               <p>Notwithſtanding in the ſeuentene of Mathew it appeareth plainly, that the Apoſtles deſiered to haue theyr Faith increaſed becauſe they could not caſt the Deuell out of the Chylde, and becauſe Chryſt had ſaid that they could not caſt out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuil by reaſon of their vnbeliefe.

                  <hi>C.</hi> The ende of this parable is this. Seeing God of his owne righte doth challenge all that we haue vnto hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſeeing wee are bounde vnto him, how dilligently ſoeuer wee ſeke to doe our duety, hee is not tyed vnto vs by any merite or deſerte, becauſe we our ſelues and all that we haue being his, he can owe noching vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chryſt ſetteth before vs the ſimillitude of a ſeruaunt who hauynge ſtrongely paſſed the whole Day wyth labour, and comming home at Night continueth at his worke vntill he haue done his duety with the which his mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter may bee pleaſed. But Chryſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not heere of hyered Seruauntes which ſerue vs at this day, but of thoſe Bondſeruauntes which were in the time of the law, which were in ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they ſought nothing for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, but did wholly labour to profit theyr mayſters. Chryſt hereby techeth that we are no leſſe bounde vnto God: whereby he gathereth that there is no reaſon why hee ſhould bee bound vnto vs. And it is an Argument of the leſſe to the more. For if ſo great power bee geuen vnto one mortall man ouer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he may tie him to contynual obedyence and ſeruice Day and night, and yet notwithſtanding geueth hym no recompence becauſe hee is his deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how much more is it lawfull for God to require all the ſeruice that we are able to doe him, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to owe nothing at al vnto vs? We ſee therefore that all they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned of wicked arrogancy whych imagine they haue deſerued any thyng at the hands of God, wherby he might be bound vnto them. And yet notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is no vice more commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then ſuch Arrogancy. For there is no man which woulde not willingly call God to an accounte. Whereuppon the fonde Imagination of merites hathe preuayled almoſt in all ages. But wee muſt note the ſentence of Chryſte that wee doe nothing freely vnto GOD: but that we are ſubiect vnto him, that we might geue vnto him all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is in our power. Therefore let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one remember that he is created to labour, and to goe forwarde in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:1180:176"/>

               <p>Thus therefore the pryde and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of the fleſh is beaten downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe howſoeuer a man fulfilleth the Lawe, hee can requyre no hyre at the hands of God, becauſe he hath don one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly his duty. And in this ſence wee are called vnprofitable Seruaunts becauſe God receyueth at our hands no ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, but onely gathereth the lawfull fruites of his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>Therefore wee muſte obſerue theſe two thinges, that God naturally ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs nothinge, and that whatſoeuer wee doe vnto him deſerueth not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a hayre: ſecondly, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde is geuen to workes by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt

of the Lawe, not for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe of the ſaid workes, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God may bee a free geuer.

What litle knowledge haue they both of the maieſty of God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of our vnworthineſſe? We ought to loue God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our whole heart: &amp; what is he that perfourmeth the ſame? Yea if we dyd it, we ſhould do no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our dutie. Let vs leane therefore to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God, and to the merit of our Lord Ieſus Chryſt, and forſake theſe vnhappy ſetters vp of mans merites. <hi>[We haue done that which was oure dutie.]</hi> Chryſt ſpeaketh heere of the whole obſeruation of the lawe, whych is to be found in no man: For he which is moſt perfecte of all other, is as yet very far from the righteouſnes whych the law requyreth.

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> This is an excellent and very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table parable by which Chryſt went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to cure a deadly diſeaſe, wyth the which all men for the moſt parte are in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected, that is to ſay, pryde, by which we doe exalte our ſelues, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue men, but alſo aboue God hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. It is wonderfull that men are ſo blynded and deceyued that they dare ſet vp their pecockes tayle before God and to boaſt of theyr merits vnto him. For howſoeuer our ambition doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch vs among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come into the preſence of God, we oughte to forget all our vaine confidence &amp; truſt. Neuertheles euery one thinketh that he is humble inough if hee by diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation craue pardon. Hereby wee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how neceſſary this admonition of the Lord is. And Chryſt in this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reprehendeth two faultes. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our wicked truſt to our ſelues, and alſo our Pryde in deſpyſing our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: the which ſprynge the one from the other. For whoſoeuer deceyueth himſelfe by a vayne truſt, it cannot bee but that he muſt needes exalte himſelfe aboue his brethren. And no marueyle for how ſhould he not deſpyſe his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals which is proude, and Exalteth himſelfe agaynſt God? And whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is puffed vp with truſt of himſelfe warreth wilfully agaynſt God, whoſe fauour we haue, onely by denying our ſelues, when wee forſaking our owne ſtrength and Righteouſneſſe, repoſe our whole truſt in his mercy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in this place ſpeaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt hipocriſie, which is much more hurtefull then ambition. It is certain that hipocrites are alwais ambitious in the ſight of God, for hipocriſie can not be ſeparated from ambition. And this is much more worſe then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. For they which boaſte themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, doe peraduenture in theyre heartes acknowledge their faults: but theſe men thinke ſo well of themſelues that they imagine God to be bounde vnto them, and dare reaſon the cauſe with him. The blaſphemies of none are more horrible then theſe. <hi>(Two men went vp into the Temple) C.</hi> Chryſte compareth two men together, bothe which ſeeming to haue a Godly deſyre to pray, doe notwithſtanding differ far one from the other. For the Phariſie comming vnto God with his externall holineſſe bryngeth the commendation of his life.

               <p>And Chryſt affirmeth that the proude Phariſie being reiected, the prayers of the poore Publicane were accepted of God.

vnto him for the merites and deſertes of his workes. For this thankes gye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing which is ſet before vs in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the one, is not of him which glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in his owne power and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, as though he had gotten righteouſnes of himſelfe, or had deſerued any thing by his owne labour: but he rather aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth it to the grace of God that hee is iuſt. And although he geuing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks vnto God, confeſſeth that whatſouer good workes he hath, they proceede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the goodnes of God, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, becauſe he truſteth to his workes and preferreth himſelfe before another he and his prayer are reiected. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we gather that men are not rightly humbled, although they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnable to doe any thinge, except alſo they diſtruſting the merites of theyr workes learne to place their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the fre mercy and goodnes of God. A notable place: ſome thynke it ſufficient if they take from men y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of good works, becauſe they are the gyftes of the holy Ghoſte: and ſo they Iudge vs to be iuſtefied frely, becauſe God findeth no Righteouſneſſe in vs, but that which he hath geuen vnto vs. But Chryſt goeth further, aſſignynge not onely the power of good workes to the grace of the Spyrite, but alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king quite and cleane from vs al truſt of workes. For the Phariſie is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this pointe, becauſe hee arrogateth that to himſelfe which is proper vnto GOD, but becauſe hee truſteth to his merites thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe worthy to haue God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable vnto him. Therefore let vs know that although a man aſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the prayſe of good workes, yet notwithſtanding if he imagine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr Righteouſnes is the cauſe of Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſtayeth himſelfe vpon the ſame, he is conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pned of peruerſe arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, Moreouer although this man doth not publiſh the fame of his owne Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe with a lowde voice, yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

In bothe theſe the Phariſie offended, becauſe he falſely challenging righteouſneſſe to himſelfe, attributed nothing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy of God: ſecondly, he condempned all men in reſpecte of himſelfe.

thankes geuing had not ben diſalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Chryſt, if it had not ben defiled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe two vices. For the onely hope of the Godly, ſo longe as they are vnder the Infirmitie of the Fleſhe, is the onely Sanctuary of Gods mercy, in the which they repoſe their whole Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Phariſie praied voide of care. And although his confeſſion ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to proceede from humillitye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he confeſſeth that whatſoeuer he hath it commeth of God: Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe hee exempteth himſelfe from the number of ſinners. He is iuſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly reiected w his praye. For he which is moſt holy ought notwithſtandynge to acknowlege himſelf to be falty in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny thinges: thus doth the iuſt man, hee confeſſeth from the Bottome of his heart that he is a ſinner.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, when we pray we ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght not to conſider ſo much how gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we haue profited, but what we want as yet, and to this wee ought to bende our whole minde. <hi>C.</hi> But it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded how he was endued with ſo much holines, which was blinded with ſo greate pryde and diſdayne. For ſo greate Integritie doth not come, but from the ſpyrit of God, which aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raigneth not in hipocrites. Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that he deceiued himſelf with an outward ſhewe of Vertues, as though the inwarde and ſecrete vncleanneſſe of the heart were not required. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore though his heart were full of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked luſtes and deſires, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding becauſe he iudged onely after the outward ſhew, he boſted of his innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Alſo it is to be noated that God in no place of the Law commaunded hys Seruauntes to faſte twiſe a Weeke, or weekely. Wherefore this faſt was a voluntary exerciſe withoute the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripte of the Law.</p>

which are of a contryte heart, can not expreſſe that which they woulde, and are conſtrayned alſo with Shame to ſpeake ſoftely.

For the Publican is not therefore ſayde to be iuſtefied, becauſe ſodainely hee got a new quallity, but becauſe his ſinnes being taken away, he obtained grace.

Therefore, as a wicked confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and truſte did pollute and defile the Vertues of the Phariſie, that hys Integritie which was commendable in the ſighte of the worlde, was of no pryce before God: euen ſo the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane being furthered with no merites of VVorkes, obtayned Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe onely by Begging Pardon and that, becauſe he had no other confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but only in the clemencie and goodnes of God.</p>

Therefore this place is notable, not ſo much for that it ouerthroweth the righteouſnes of workes, as that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we vnderſtand what it is to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, namely, by the mere grace and mercie of God, not to haue our ſinns imputed vnto vs: to be accepted of God, not for the merite of works, but through Chriſte: as ſaith Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, <hi>We are firſt iuſtified, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward ſanctified by the holy ghoſt.</hi> (For euery one that exalteth himſelf) This ſentence was as a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, as was that alſo going before in the <hi>14.</hi> Chapter verſe <hi>11.</hi> which the Lorde vſed in the <hi>23.</hi> Chapter of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew alſo verſe <hi>12.</hi> Where this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. <hi>R.</hi> With the which ſentence agreeth this ſaying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>He hath put downe the mightie from their ſeate,</hi>

Therefore this man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and contemned in like maner of men. And he humbleth himſelf whych following his calling ſheweth himſelf dutifull and lowly to euery one. And he which thus behaueth himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men is alſo exalted of men. But he exalteth himſelfe before God which aſcribeth righteouſnes to his own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and not onely that, but alſo al the giftes of God.

Countrey to receiue a Kyngedome, &amp; calling his Seruants vnto him, gaue vnto euery one of them a Pounde, that in his abſence they might bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed. And, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt toulde this parable, the Euangelyſte ſheweth in few and manifeſt wordes. <hi>BV.</hi> The Diſciples (as we haue ſaid oftentimes) thought that the Kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chryſt ſhould be Carnal and Earthly, and that it ſhould eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhortly begin at Hieruſalem. Wherefore the Lord ſheweth that his kingdom ſhall be celeſtiall: and that he would aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d into heauen when he had diſpoſed and ordered his Apoſtles, and geuen to them the holy Ghoſt to go forth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole worlde, that is to ſay, to brynge them by the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kingdome of Chryſt. <hi>C.</hi> Howe bee it this is monſterous ignoraunce, that the diſciples being ſo oftentimes tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte concerning the Death of Chryſte at hand, would notwithſtandynge ſtyll talke of his kingdome. And here was a double error: Firſt, that they imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a bleſſed reſt without the croſſe, Secondly: becauſe they iudged of the Kingdome of God by carnall reaſon. Whereby it doth appeare how ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der and obſcure their Faith was. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had taſted the hope of the Reſurrection, yet notwithſtanding it was ſo ſmall that they held nothynge firme and certaine concerning Chryſt. They beleue the redemer which was promiſed longe before, whereby they conceiue the hope of the renouation of the Church, but the ſame knowledge tourneth by and by into fained imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which either peruerte or obſcure the force of his Kingdome. This is brutiſh dulneſſe to haſten to the Triumph before the battayle was begun: ſpecially ſeeing Chryſt a litle before toulde them that a ſharpe and and ſhamefull death tarried for him. <hi>A.</hi> Thus we ſee that many infirmities remaine in the Sainctes, and greate imbecillity of faith oftentimes, to the ende we may know that Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But Hypocrites do nothing but for a rewarde, and do promiſe vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for theyr merites not onelie the Felicity of this world, but alſo great happyneſſe in the Kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>And whereas ſome thinke it verye abſurde for Chryſt to bewayle that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill which he might haue holpen, they may eaſely be aunſwered.

               </p>
               <p>For this word (Day) is taken aſwell for the Iudgement as for the mercy of God. When hee puniſheth hee calleth alſo to repentaunce: but hys mercy is greater when hee calleth vs by cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and pitie, and not wyth ſtrypes and affliction. But we muſt note that the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1180:192"/>
Lord doth oftentimes call vs, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (that is to ſay) more openly at one time then at another.</p>
               <p>Sometime hee ſeemeth to forſake his Church, euen as if the truthe were quite extinguiſhed as we haue felt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Antechryſte. But now in geuynge vs Lighte by his Goſpell, he dothe as it were reache oute his hand vnto vs. There is therefore a ſpeciall callynge to the which excepte we aunſwere wee ſhall haue afterward no excuſe.</p>
               <p>No man can complaine that hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth calling, but yet notwithſtandyng our Fathers ſhall not ſuffer ſo greate Iudgement as we ſhall: becauſe they ſaw not that Day which wee ſee. The faulte increaſeth according to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time, and the puniſhment of the faulte is more or leſſe according to the degree. <hi>C.</hi> Wherefore the more nigh that God commeth vnto vs, and offereth vnto vs the Lighte of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. If we neglect the ſame, the leſſe excuſe we haue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Which belonge vnto thy peace) C.</hi> By the name of peace, hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth all the partes of Felicitye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrue phraſe. As if he ſhould ſay. Which is thy true bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and which way thou muſt attain to the ſame. For he doth not ſimpelye ſaye that Hieruſalem knewe not her peace, but the thinges which belonge vnto her peace, becauſe it is often ſene that men knowe their felicity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blynded with their owne wycked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they know not the way &amp; means to come by the ſame. As for example: All men confeſſe that it is Felicitye to be ioyned with God, but yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte the Goſpell which is the mean to obtaine the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(But now are they hidden.) C.</hi> This is ſpoken to deminiſh the faulte of Hieruſalem: For her monſterouſe blyndnes is rather noted to her ſhame and reproach, becauſe ſhe ſaw not God when he was preſent. For Chryſt was very GOD, manifeſted in the Fleſh: whome to reiecte what blyndneſſe can be more horrible? We graunte that it belongeth to God onely to illumyne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes of mens mindes, and that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is meete to vnderſtand the miſteries of the Kingdome of heauen, excepte God doe illuminate his minde by his holy ſpyrite: but therefore they are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of pardon which periſhe by theyre brutiſh blyndeneſſe. Alſo our Sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chryſt mente hereby to take away the offences which otherwiſe myghte hynder the rude and weak. For ſeeing all men had that City in eſtimation, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Example thereof two waies was of greate waighte, either to hurt, or to profite. Therefore leſte the vnbeliefe thereof, and proude contempt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell might hynder or hurte any man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fowle blyndneſſe is condempned.</p>

And the time of mercye and Saluation is when the woorde of God is reuealed, by which the clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God is offered vnto vs, and by which wee are called to repentance, &amp; are admoniſhed to receiue the Grace offered vnto vs.</p>
               <p>So it was the time of Saluation when Noe by the worde of God called thoſe of his time to repentaunce before the Floude.</p>
               <p>So it was the time of Saluatyon when Lot called the Sodomites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fire came from heauen, when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes called the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> before the

And theſe were the Wickedneſſes, for the which the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſo miſerabely peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For although they ſought by all meanes to deliuer them ſelues from Deſtruction and to be ſaued: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſought to bee ſaued, they loſt Saluation. <hi>A.</hi> For <hi>Iſraell</hi> ſayeth <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore, becauſe <hi>Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Wherefore let the ſeuerity of thoſe puniſhmentes which happened vnto them terrefie vs, leaſt by our Negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence we extinguiſh the light of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but rather let vs erneſtly ſeke to receiue the Grace of God. <hi>R.</hi> For if God (ſayth <hi>S.

In this feaſt of paſſeouer, Chryſte was to ſuffer a moſt ſhamefull and cruell death. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man woulde haue deſiered by all maner of meanes to ſhunne and eſcape ſo horrible a death. But Chriſt rather deſiereth to ſuffer the ſame.

If Chryſte had called vs to ſuch labor as might rather haue brought dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then profit, we might peraduenture make excuſe, and turne our ſelues another way: but nowe hee hath called vs to thoſe labors, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thoſe Felicities which ſhal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way brynge Saluation with them. For euery one that beleeueth in hym ſhall not be confounded. Why then do we delay to take them in hande and to follow them.

               <p>Wherefore, when we heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chryſte did eate after his reſurrection, let vs impute it to the cauſe afore alleadged. <hi>C.</hi> And here the faithful muſt omit all curious queſtions as theſe.

Therefore as Chryſt did truly taſte the fiſh and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicombe, to ſhewe himſelfe to be man, ſo there is no doubte but that by his deuine power, he conſumed that which hee had no neede to receiue to hys nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.<note place="margin">Gen. 18.8.</note> So in like maner we doubte not but that the Aungels did eate and drynke at Abrahams <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, in repentance and remi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of ſinnes, the ſumme of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is reprehended, as appeareth by diuers places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>In repentance we muſt be very dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent.

For although the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did oftentimes foreſhew the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles, yet neuertheleſſe the ſame was not ſo reuealed: that the Iewes would eaſely graunte them to be partakers of the ſame with them.
